>Case Study: Fake News Detection using Data Science 

PROJECT RUNDOWN

Due to the rate at which information is generated across the world every second, it is a necessity to ascertain the authenticity of the news especially in times such as this where the weight of news determines the well-being of man. After much verification and cross-checking of various algorithms, the Passive-Aggressive Classifier proved the most suitable and yielded the highest accuracy because of its online nature of classification. The PAC checks with the help of pre-defined criteria what determines real from fake news, classifies them into their labels, thus solving this misinformation problem and ensuring decision making on the accurate results possible.

This study proposed the use of a Passive-Aggressive Classifier, a form of data classification, that evaluated the efficacy of the algorithm used to classify fake news from legitimate news. A training dataset was used to construct the classification model for this analysis, and a test dataset was used to test the efficiency of the built classification model.
This project aims to solve this problem by creating an algorithm that uses the Passive-Aggressive Classifier to search, using pre-defined parameters, what distinguishes real news from fake news, thereby classifying them to their labels thus solving the problem and allowing for accurate decision-making.
From the analysis of the dataset (20,800 entries) inputted and compared with the PAC that gave an accuracy of 96.33%, the output showed that 72% of the time it would accurately predict a news article be true and 69% of the time it would accurately predict the article be fake.
